## Hi there, I'm Marcel

Born in 1986. Lived in a number of places both in The Netherlands and in Belgium, current location is Ede. Working for <a href="http://wakoopa.com">Wakoopa</a> in Amsterdam, mostly on Ruby and Javascript code and an interesting Amazon Web Services based architecture.

In my spare time I take on freelance developing gigs. You can also hire me as a drummer or percussionist.
