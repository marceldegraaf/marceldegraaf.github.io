title: My OS/X toolbar - the tools I daily use
---

In this post I'd like to walk you through my OS/X toolbar, to share the tools I daily use. Hopefully you'll find
these as useful as I do!

Without further ado:

![My toolbar](http://i.marceldegraaf.net/_20140313_203257.jpg)

[Twitter](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12)
– keeping me informed of what happens on Twitter.

[Trailer](http://dev.housetrip.com/trailer/)
– shows OS/X notifications for updates to Github Pull Request I'm involved in.

[Chrome Notifications](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
– desktop notifications from the Chrome browser.

[F.lux](http://justgetflux.com/)
– changes the color of my display according to the time of day. If you stare at a screen for most of your day, do
yourself a favor and please install this. It's awesome.

[Elastics](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elastics/id418982422?mt=12)
– quick statistics from (and access to) running Amazon Web Services EC2 instances.

[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)
– a beautifully designed Mac calendar application.

[Monosnap](http://monosnap.com/welcome)
– everything Skitch used to provide, and much more. Really useful application to quickly snap screenshots
(and annotate them when needed).

[BreakTime](http://breaktimeapp.com/)
– helps me take regular breaks from working.

[BitTorrent Sync](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync)
– file sharing application based on BitTorrent.

[Isolator](http://willmore.eu/software/isolator/)
– I like only having the active window being visible. Isolator hides all non-active windows.

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)
– launcher and productivity application. Really, use this.

[Arq](http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/)
– locally encrypted backups to Amazon Web Services Glacier, S3, and other S3 compatible storage platforms.

[Sparrow](http://sparrowmailapp.com/)
– the (unfortunately, abandoned) email client. Looking for a better alternative. Please let me know
([@marceldegraaf](http://twitter.com/marceldegraaf)) if you know a good email client I should try.

[Screenhero](http://screenhero.com/)
– remote pair programming made easy. This application is great for working together remotely.

[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/)
– Duh.

[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword)
– manages all my passwords, credentials, and other secure bits of information. Seriously, use this.
